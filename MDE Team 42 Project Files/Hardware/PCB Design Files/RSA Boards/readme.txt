RSA Board Files:

These board files are in a .json format.  They were created using the EasyEDA software.
This software exports its layouts and schematics in this format.  They can be viewed/
edited using EasyEDA by importing these .json files.

NOTES FOR FURTHER REVISIONS:

-The Motherboard has a port that is not properly spaced
-The Motherboard can be a lot smaller
-The Modular Card can be a lot smaller
-The Modular Card needs its signal transformer removed (it will go up in smoke if you keep it)
-Add some sort of usb/debug output on the motherboard, this will save you a lot of time and headaches
